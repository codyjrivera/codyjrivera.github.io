## About Me

Hi! I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in programming languages and formal methods, with more specific interests in verifying systems software. I currently work with [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) on compositional verification of liveness properties for Kubernetes controllers. We are implementing support for this on top of [Anvil](https://github.com/anvil-verifier/anvil), a Kubernetes verification framework built on top of the Rust verifier Verus. I have previously worked with [Madhusudan Parthasarathy](http://madhu.cs.illinois.edu/) to develop a predictable automatic verification paradigm based on intrinsic, or local, definitions rather than recursive definitions.

Prior to joining Illinois, I did research in high-performance computing at the University of Alabama, where I worked with [Dingwen Tao](https://www.dingwentao.com/). My research focused on using GPU performance engineering to improve scientific computing applications.

See my CV [here](assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf), and please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
